# Hartree-Fock and Post Hartree-Fock Quantum Computing
---
This repository is built by **Ronit Dutta** and serves as a primer for Hartree Fock Quantum Computing. The reference material for this repo is taken from the paper [The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05176). I plan to build code for the practices and techniques mention in this foundational Quantum Chemistry paper, and the notebooks serve as a primer for understanding the intricacies of the same. This is an ongoing project by me. This contains error *mitigation strategies* , *subspace search algorithms*, *hybrid quantum* as well as *full quantum eigensolvers* for both **molecular** and **lattice** configurations in chemistry.
